# Hydrogen Redirect Theme

[Download](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen-redirect-theme/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

When launching a Hydrogen storefront, youâ€™ll likely also want to redirect
any traffic that happens to hit your Liquid store too. This theme allows you
helps you do that while also making sure you retain features like the bot
detection checkpoint, and discount links.

## Setup

1. [Download the theme](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen-redirect-theme/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
2. Navigate to **Online Store -> Themes** in your Shopify admin
3. **Upload** the theme to your Theme Library
4. **Customize** the Redirect theme
5. Go to **Theme settings -> Storefront** and configure `storefront_hostname`
6. **Publish** the theme

## Custom redirects

You can configure the `custom_redirects` value in **Theme settings > Storefront**.

The redirect rule format is as following:

```
Shopify path > Storefront path
```

Each line in the textarea represents a single redirect rule.

### Example configuration

The example below removes the `/account` prefix from the login, register and reset password redirects.

```
/account/login > /login
/account/register > /register
/account/reset > /reset-password
/account/activate > /activate-account
```

## Customer accounts integration

You can integrate with [customer accounts](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/customers/customer-accounts/new-customer-accounts) by enabling it in **Theme settings > Integrate with customer accounts**.

This will add query params to the redirect URL based on the situation:

- `logged_in=true`: Present only if the customer has logged in. You can use this value to initiate a [login](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/hydrogen/2024-01/utilities/createcustomeraccountclient#returns-propertydetail-login) that should be transparent to the customer.
- `company_location_id=<id>`: Present only if your store is B2B-enabled, a B2B customer has logged in, and has selected a location. Your storefront should still confirm whether the customer has access to this location through the Customer Account API.

## Gift cards

Since the Shopify Storefront API does not yet support fetching gift cards, a customizable `gift_card.liquid` template has been added.

## Checkpoint template for Bot Protection
